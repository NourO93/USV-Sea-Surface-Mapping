All .m file is previous versions we implemented for different functionality, but we combine them as we add more functionality.
	speed.m is for plotting speed
	depthFrame.m is for frequency plot generating
	slope_valid.m is for validating slope with covariance and wave front
	


All .mat file is the data we collected
	waveBack waveFront and WaveTop is the data as the whole image
	sectorFront sectorTop and sectorBack is the data as the sectors
	slope is the slopes of covariance and wave front
	freqData is the data collected for 150s video
